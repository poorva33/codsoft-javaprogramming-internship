Task 1 : The provided Java code implements a Number Guessing Game using the Swing framework for a graphical user interface. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts. The main interface includes an instruction label, a text field for inputting guesses, a button for submitting guesses, and feedback labels to indicate progress. Players receive hints such as "Too Low" or "Too High" after each guess, and the remaining number of attempts is displayed. If the player guesses correctly, they are congratulated, and their "Rounds Won" count is updated. A "Next Round" button enables users to reset the game with a new random number and 10 fresh attempts. The game ensures input validation, providing appropriate feedback for invalid inputs or numbers outside the range. The interface is user-friendly, with a clean layout, responsive buttons, and score tracking, making the game engaging and easy to play.
Task 2 : The StudentGradeCalculator program is a Java application that calculates and displays the total marks, average percentage, and grade for a student based on their performance across multiple subjects. It begins by prompting the user to input the number of subjects and the marks obtained in each subject (out of 100). The program calculates the total marks by summing up the scores entered and computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. Based on the calculated average percentage, it assigns a grade using a grading scale where 'A' is for percentages 90 and above, 'B' for 80-89, and so on, with 'F' being a failing grade. Finally, the program displays the results, including the total marks, average percentage (formatted to two decimal places), and the assigned grade.
Task 4 : The provided Java code implements a Currency Converter application using the Swing framework for a graphical user interface. The application allows users to input an amount, select the source currency, and choose the target currency from dropdown menus. It calculates the equivalent amount in the target currency based on real-time exchange rates fetched from an online API. The interface features a styled, user-friendly design with labels, text fields, combo boxes for currency selection, and a "Convert" button. The application validates user input and displays the converted amount in a green-highlighted label, or provides an error message if invalid data is entered. The API interaction is implemented to fetch exchange rates dynamically, parsing JSON responses to extract the required exchange rate. The main class initializes the frame with custom styling, including a white background, purple accents, and light purple combo boxes, ensuring an aesthetic and intuitive user experience.
